# Download UO Razor

???+ tip "Client Support"
    It's **highly recommended** that you use the [ClassicUO](https://www.classicuo.eu/) client with this version of Razor, however it should work with the original 5.x and 7.x clients though support for any bugs may be limited.

    If you plan on using Razor with the original client, download the `x86` version otherwise download `x64` for ClassicUO.
