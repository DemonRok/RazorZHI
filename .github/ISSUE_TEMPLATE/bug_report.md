**Please include if you are using the standard OSI client or using ClassicUO.**

Remember, **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific! This can be challenging at times in a game like UO, but the more specific you are, the easier it is to fix
  - Include screenshots, gifs, videos if possible. Free apps like ShareX and Greenshot make it easy.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
